# Collaborative Data Collection Guide - Team of 4

## Overview

This guide explains how to collect traffic data with a team of 4 people working in parallel, then merge the results for SIMUL8 analysis.

**Team Structure:**
- **Person 1:** Westbound (WB) Vehicles only
- **Person 2:** Eastbound (EB) Vehicles only
- **Person 3:** Crossers (pedestrians who just cross) only
- **Person 4:** Posers (pedestrians who stop for photos) only

**Benefits:**
- 4× faster data collection
- Minimal individual workload
- Excellent focus (each person watches ONE entity type)
- Lowest error rate (complete specialization)
- Parallel processing of same video

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Team

**Assign roles clearly:**

**Person 1 - WB Vehicle Specialist:**
- Focus: Westbound vehicles ONLY
- Watch: Right side of road
- Count: Cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks going westbound
- Ignore: Eastbound vehicles, pedestrians

**Person 2 - EB Vehicle Specialist:**
- Focus: Eastbound vehicles ONLY
- Watch: Left side of road
- Count: Cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks going eastbound
- Ignore: Westbound vehicles, pedestrians

**Person 3 - Crossers Specialist:**
- Focus: Crossers ONLY
- Watch: Crosswalk area
- Count: Pedestrians who just cross (no stopping)
- Ignore: All vehicles, Posers

**Person 4 - Posers Specialist:**
- Focus: Posers ONLY
- Watch: Crosswalk area
- Count: Pedestrians who stop for photos
- Ignore: All vehicles, Crossers

### Step 2: Synchronize Video

**IMPORTANT:** All 4 people must watch the SAME video segment at the SAME time.

**Synchronization method:**

**Option A: Same computer, different sessions**
```
1. Open video in 4 browser tabs
2. Synchronize start time
3. Each person counts their assigned entities
4. Export separately when done
```

**Option B: Different computers, synchronized start**
```
1. Copy video file to all 4 computers
2. Use countdown: "3, 2, 1, Start!"
3. Everyone presses play simultaneously
4. Use same playback speed (recommend 1× for accuracy)
```

**Option C: Shared screen session**
```
1. One person shares screen
2. All watch same video playback
3. Each person keeps their own annotation window open
4. Count assigned entities only
```

### Step 3: Use Annotation Tool

Each person opens the manual annotation tool:

**File:** `mkv-annotation-tool.html`

**Configuration for each person:**

**Person 1 (WB Vehicles):**
- Use only: "WB Vehicles" button
- Ignore all other buttons
- Focus on right half of screen

**Person 2 (EB Vehicles):**
- Use only: "EB Vehicles" button
- Ignore all other buttons
- Focus on left half of screen

**Person 3 (Crossers):**
- Use only: "Ped Start" and "Crosser End" buttons
- Ignore vehicle buttons and "Poser End"
- Focus on crosswalk area

**Person 4 (Posers):**
- Use only: "Ped Start" and "Poser End" buttons
- Ignore vehicle buttons and "Crosser End"
- Focus on crosswalk area

## Data Collection Process

### During Annotation

**Best practices:**

1. **Stay focused on your assignment**
   - Don't try to count everything
   - Trust teammates to count their entities
   - If unsure, skip rather than guess

2. **Use consistent timing**
   - All play video at same speed
   - Pause together if needed
   - Resume together

3. **Take breaks together**
   - Coordinate break times
   - Resume from same timestamp
   - Verify synchronization after breaks

4. **Communication**
   - Use voice/text chat if needed
   - Alert team if you need to restart
   - Confirm completion before exporting

### After Completion

**Each person exports their CSV:**

**Person 1 exports:** `wb_vehicles.csv`
**Person 2 exports:** `eb_vehicles.csv`
**Person 3 exports:** `crossers.csv`
**Person 4 exports:** `posers.csv`

**Naming convention:**
```
[role]_[date]_[time].csv

Examples:
wb_vehicles_2025-10-28_morning.csv
eb_vehicles_2025-10-28_morning.csv
crossers_2025-10-28_morning.csv
posers_2025-10-28_morning.csv
```

## Merging CSV Files

### Use the Merge Script

A Python script is provided to merge all 4 CSV files into one combined file for SIMUL8.

**Script:** `merge_team_data.py`

**Usage:**
```bash
python merge_team_data.py wb_vehicles.csv eb_vehicles.csv crossers.csv posers.csv
```

**Output:** `combined_results.csv`

### Manual Verification Steps

Before using merged data:

1. **Check total count**
   ```
   Person 1 WB count: 45
   Person 2 EB count: 38
   Person 3 Pedestrians: 22
   Combined total: 105 ✓
   ```

2. **Verify no duplicates**
   - Each arrival should have unique ID
   - No overlapping timestamps for same entity type

3. **Check time consistency**
   - All timestamps should be within video duration
   - Earliest time > 0
   - Latest time < video duration

4. **Validate format**
   - All required columns present
   - No empty cells (except Service Time)
   - Inter-arrival times calculated correctly

## Quality Assurance

### Before Merging

**Each person checks their own file:**

- [ ] File exported successfully
- [ ] Contains data (not empty)
- [ ] Correct entity types only
- [ ] Timestamps look reasonable
- [ ] No obvious errors

### After Merging

**Team leader validates:**

- [ ] All 4 files merged successfully
- [ ] Total count matches sum of individuals
- [ ] IDs are sequential (1, 2, 3...)
- [ ] Times are chronologically ordered
- [ ] No missing or duplicate entries

## Advantages of This Approach

### vs. Single Person

**Speed:**
- Single person: ~6-8 hours for full video
- Team of 4: ~2-3 hours (each person does 1/4 work)
- **Time saved:** 60-70%

**Accuracy:**
- Single person: Must track 4 entity types
- Team member: Tracks exactly 1 entity type
- **Minimal cognitive load:** Perfect focus = fewest errors

**Workload:**
- Single person: 100% of work
- Each team member: ~25% of work
- **Fair distribution:** Equal contribution

### vs. ML System (on CPU)

**Speed comparison for 6.9-hour video:**
- ML on CPU: ~280 hours (11.6 days)
- Team of 4: ~2-3 hours each
- **Manual is 100× faster** than CPU-based ML

**Accuracy:**
- ML: ~90% (may miss edge cases)
- Human: ~95-98% (with focus and QA)
- **Human more accurate** for complex scenarios

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Synchronization Lost

**Symptom:** Team members at different points in video

**Solution:**
```
1. Pause video immediately
2. Agree on current timestamp
3. All seek to same time
4. Count down and resume together
```

### Challenge 2: Overlapping Counts

**Symptom:** Two people counting same entity

**Example:** Person 2 counts motorcycle as EB vehicle, Person 3 thinks it's carrying a passenger and focuses on it

**Solution:**
- Stick to vehicle vs pedestrian distinction
- Person on motorcycle = vehicle (Person 2 counts)
- Person walking = pedestrian (Person 3 counts)
- Clear rules established before starting

### Challenge 3: Different Export Formats

**Symptom:** CSV files have different column orders or names

**Solution:**
- All use same version of annotation tool
- Export using CSV (not Excel) for consistency
- Use merge script which handles column ordering

### Challenge 4: Missing Data in One File

**Symptom:** One person's file is empty or very short

**Possible causes:**
- Browser crash
- Wrong entity type selected
- Didn't press count buttons

**Solution:**
- That person re-does their segment
- Use backup saves if available
- Team waits for completion before merging

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Pre-Session (5-10 minutes)

**Team leader:**
1. Prepare video file
2. Test annotation tool works on all computers
3. Assign roles (WB, EB, Pedestrians)
4. Explain rules and boundaries
5. Do quick 1-minute practice run

### Data Collection Session (2-3 hours)

**Timeline for 6.9-hour video:**
```
0:00-0:05  Setup and synchronization
0:05-2:35  Annotation session (play at 1× speed)
2:35-2:45  Export individual files
2:45-2:55  Merge files and validate
2:55-3:00  Upload to SIMUL8
```

**With playback at 1.5×:**
```
0:00-0:05  Setup
0:05-1:50  Annotation (faster playback)
1:50-2:00  Export and merge
Total: ~2 hours
```

### Post-Session (10-15 minutes)

1. Each person exports CSV
2. Team leader collects all 3 files
3. Run merge script
4. Validate combined file
5. Upload to SIMUL8
6. Archive individual files (backup)

## File Organization

### Folder Structure

```
project/
├── video/
│   └── 2025-10-20_08-50-33.mkv
├── individual_data/
│   ├── wb_vehicles_2025-10-28.csv
│   ├── eb_vehicles_2025-10-28.csv
│   ├── crossers_2025-10-28.csv
│   └── posers_2025-10-28.csv
├── merged_data/
│   └── combined_results_2025-10-28.csv
└── simul8/
    └── [Import combined_results.csv here]
```

### Backup Strategy

**After each session:**
1. Copy individual CSVs to backup folder
2. Copy merged CSV to backup folder
3. Timestamp all files
4. Keep for 1 week before cleanup

**Example naming:**
```
backup_2025-10-28/
├── wb_vehicles_2025-10-28_backup.csv
├── eb_vehicles_2025-10-28_backup.csv
├── crossers_2025-10-28_backup.csv
├── posers_2025-10-28_backup.csv
└── combined_results_2025-10-28_backup.csv
```

---

## SIMUL8 Import

### Combined CSV Format

The merged file will have this format:

```csv
ID,Time (s),Entity,Type/Dir,Inter-Arrival (s),Service Time (s)
1,7.2,EB Vehicles,EB,0.0,-
2,9.5,WB Vehicles,WB,0.0,-
3,12.1,EB Vehicles,EB,4.9,-
4,15.8,Crossers,Crosser,0.0,-
5,18.3,WB Vehicles,WB,8.8,-
...
```

**This is the exact format SIMUL8 expects.**

### Import to SIMUL8

1. Open SIMUL8
2. Go to Data Import
3. Select `combined_results.csv`
4. Map columns:
   - Time → Arrival Time
   - Entity → Entity Type
   - Inter-Arrival → Inter-Arrival Time
5. Run simulation

- Resume together after break

**3. Quality Over Speed**
- Better to go slower and be accurate
- Skip uncertain entries rather than guess
- Review counts together if time allows

**4. Practice First**
- Do 5-minute practice segment
- Verify everyone understands their role
- Test export and merge process
- Iron out issues before full session

**5. Document Everything**
- Note session start time
- Record any issues encountered
- Document video segments covered
- Keep logs for reference

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: CSVs Won't Merge

**Check:**
- All files in same folder
- File names correct
- No typos in command
- Python installed correctly

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify files exist
ls *.csv

# Try merge with full paths
python merge_team_data.py /full/path/to/wb_vehicles.csv ...
```

### Problem: Merged File Has Wrong Count

**Check:**
- Each person counted correct entity type
- No one accidentally counted others' entities
- Export completed successfully (not partial)

**Fix:**
- Review individual files
- Re-export if needed
- Re-run merge script

### Problem: Times Don't Match

**Symptom:** Same event at different times in different files

**Cause:** Videos not synchronized

**Fix:**
- Restart session
- Use countdown method
- Double-check everyone starts together
