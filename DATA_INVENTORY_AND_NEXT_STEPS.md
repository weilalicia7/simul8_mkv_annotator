## Preliminary Analysis Results

### Key Findings from Partial Data:

**1. Traffic Patterns:**
- WB Vehicles: 506 arrivals (67% of traffic)
- Pedestrians: 252 arrivals (33% of traffic)
  - Crossers: 102 (40% of pedestrians)
  - Posers: 150 (60% of pedestrians)

**2. Inter-Arrival Times:**
- WB Vehicles: 10.6 seconds average (high variability: σ=13.7s)
- Crossers: 51.7 seconds average (high variability: σ=54.6s)
- Posers: 34.8 seconds average (very high variability: σ=68.0s)

**3. Service Times (Pedestrians):**
- Crossers: 7.2 seconds average (quick crossing)
- Posers: 11.0 seconds average (stop for photos)
- Maximum poser time: 50.6 seconds!

**4. Key Insights:**
- **Posers take 52% longer than Crossers** (11.0s vs 7.2s)
- High variability in both arrivals and service times (CV > 1.0)
- Suggests need for significant capacity buffer in queueing analysis

## What You Can Do NOW (Without EB Data)

### 1. Validate Data Quality ✓

```bash
# Already done - data looks good!
# Files created in standardized format:
- data set/wb_vehicles.csv
- data set/eb_vehicles.csv (placeholder)
- data set/crossers.csv
- data set/posers.csv
```

### 2. Preliminary Traffic Analysis ✓

```bash
# Already completed - see generated files:
- traffic_analysis_report.txt
- traffic_metrics.json
- time_analysis.png
- cost_analysis.png
```

**Generated Insights:**
- System utilization: 44.5%
- Daily cost estimate: £1,801
- Annual cost estimate: £657,437

### 3. Test SIMUL8 Import (WB Only)

**What to do:**
1. Open SIMUL8
2. Import `wb_vehicles.csv`
3. Create simple single-direction model
4. Test with your WB vehicle data
5. Validate model behavior

**Purpose:** Practice SIMUL8 setup before adding full bidirectional traffic

### 4. Pedestrian Behavior Analysis

**Research Questions You Can Answer NOW:**
- How much longer do Posers take vs Crossers? ✓ (Answer: 52% longer)
- What's the ratio of Posers to Crossers? ✓ (Answer: 60:40)
- Are Posers more variable than Crossers? ✓ (Answer: Yes, σ=68s vs 55s)
- What's the longest Poser time? ✓ (Answer: 50.6 seconds)

**Use in Report:**
- Justifies separate modeling of Poser vs Crosser behavior
- Demonstrates data collection methodology works
- Shows tourist impact on crossing times

---

## What You CANNOT Do Yet (Need EB Data)

### 1. Bidirectional Traffic Analysis ✗
- Cannot calculate EB arrival rates
- Cannot compare EB vs WB patterns
- Cannot model traffic conflicts

### 2. Complete Variability Analysis ✗
```bash
# Will not work properly without EB:
python variability_analyzer.py all_sessions_combined.csv
# Will only show WB patterns, missing EB
```

### 3. Full Queueing Theory Analysis ✗
```bash
# Will give incomplete results:
python queueing_calculator.py all_sessions_combined.csv 60
# Cannot determine optimal capacity for bidirectional traffic
```

### 4. Complete Cost-Benefit Analysis ✗
- Delay costs only account for one direction
- Cannot assess true congestion impact
- Resource requirements incomplete

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Collect EB Vehicle Data

**When:** As soon as possible
**Duration:** Same 90-minute window (for consistency)
**Method:** Use HTML annotation tool
**File to create:** `eb_vehicles.csv`

**Recommendation:** Collect from SAME video segment (10:00-20:00) to ensure:
- Consistent time period
- Matching traffic conditions
- Valid comparisons between EB and WB

### Priority 2: Complete Data Collection Checklist

Before collecting EB data, verify:
- [ ] HTML annotation tool working properly (test playback speeds)
- [ ] Understand EB vs WB vehicle distinction clearly
- [ ] Have video segment loaded and ready (10:00-20:00)
- [ ] Export destination folder prepared
- [ ] Estimated time: 60-90 minutes

### Priority 3: After EB Collection

Once you have EB vehicles data:

```bash
# Step 1: Merge all 4 datasets
python merge_team_data.py "data set/wb_vehicles.csv" "data set/eb_vehicles.csv" "data set/crossers.csv" "data set/posers.csv"

# Step 2: Run complete analysis
python traffic_analyzer.py

# Step 3: Run variability analysis
python variability_analyzer.py all_sessions_combined.csv

# Step 4: Run queueing analysis
python queueing_calculator.py all_sessions_combined.csv 60

# Step 5: Generate resource plan
python resource_planner.py 10000
```
