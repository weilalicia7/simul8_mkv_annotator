## üéØ Overview

### What This Is

You're being asked to help process traffic videos using machine learning. The videos show pedestrian crossings, and the ML system automatically detects and counts:
- Vehicles (eastbound and westbound)
- Pedestrians (crossing or waiting)

### Why Your Computer?

Your computer has an **NVIDIA RTX 4060 6GB GPU**, which can process these videos **15-25 times faster** than a regular CPU-only computer. What would take 11+ days on a normal computer will take only 4-8 hours on yours!

### Time Commitment

- **Setup:** 20-30 minutes (first time only)
- **Processing:** 4-8 hours (can run overnight, unattended)
- **Your involvement:** Just start it and let it run - no manual work needed

## üöÄ Processing Videos

### Quick Test (Recommended First)

**Test with 30-second clip first to verify everything works:**

```cmd
python -u ml_processor.py test_30sec.mp4 --output test_results.csv
```

**Expected:**
- Should complete in **1-2 seconds** (on GPU)
- Creates file `test_results.csv`
- Shows progress: "Progress: 100.0% (1800/1800 frames)"

**If this works, proceed to full video!**

---

### Process Full Video

**Basic command:**
```cmd
python -u ml_processor.py "2025-10-20 08-50-33.mkv" --output results.csv
```

**With custom settings:**
```cmd
python -u ml_processor.py "2025-10-20 08-50-33.mkv" --output results.csv --confidence 0.35
```

### What Will Happen

**You'll see output like this:**
```
Loading YOLO model...
Video loaded: 1280x720 @ 60.0 FPS
Total frames: 1,499,704
Arrival line at Y=360

Starting video processing...

Progress: 5.0% (74985/1499704 frames) - Detected: 45 arrivals
Progress: 10.0% (149970/1499704 frames) - Detected: 98 arrivals
Progress: 15.0% (224955/1499704 frames) - Detected: 152 arrivals
...
```

**Progress updates every 100 frames** (so you know it's working)

### Let It Run

**Time estimates for 6.9-hour video:**
- **On your RTX 4060:** 4-8 hours
- **Best approach:** Start before bed, wake up to completed results!

**The program will:**
- ‚úÖ Show regular progress updates
- ‚úÖ Save results automatically when done
- ‚úÖ Exit cleanly with success message

**You don't need to:**
- ‚ùå Watch it the whole time
- ‚ùå Click anything during processing
- ‚ùå Keep using the computer (but you can!)

### Running Overnight

**Prevent computer from sleeping:**

1. **Settings** ‚Üí **System** ‚Üí **Power & Sleep**
2. Set "When plugged in, PC goes to sleep after" ‚Üí **Never**
3. Close lid (if laptop) or minimize Command Prompt

python -u ml_processor.py "C:\Users\John\Videos\2025-10-20 08-50-33.mkv" --output results.csv
```

**C) Navigate to video folder first:**
```cmd
cd "C:\Users\John\Videos"
python -u ml_processor.py "2025-10-20 08-50-33.mkv" --output results.csv
```

---

### Issue 4: Processing Very Slow (Still 1-2 FPS)

**Problem:** Not using GPU, still running on CPU

**Check GPU usage while processing:**

**Open new Command Prompt and run:**
```cmd
nvidia-smi
```

**Look for:**
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Processes:                                                                  |
|  GPU   GI   CI        PID   Type   Process name                  GPU Memory |
|        ID   ID                                                   Usage      |
|=============================================================================|
|    0   N/A  N/A      12345    C   python.exe                      1234MiB   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**If you see python.exe using GPU memory:** ‚úÖ GPU is working!

**If no python.exe listed:** ‚ùå Running on CPU

**Fix:**
```cmd
# Verify PyTorch CUDA version
python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"

# Should print: 11.8 or 12.1
# If prints "None", reinstall CUDA-enabled PyTorch
```

## üéì Background Information (Optional Reading)

### What the ML System Does

**Detection Process:**
1. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** - Detects objects in each frame
   - Identifies vehicles (cars, buses, trucks)
   - Identifies pedestrians
   - Draws bounding boxes around each

2. **DeepSORT** - Tracks objects across frames
   - Assigns unique ID to each entity
   - Follows them through the video
   - Maintains identity even if briefly hidden

3. **Classification** - Categorizes each entity
   - **EB Vehicles** - Eastbound vehicles
   - **WB Vehicles** - Westbound vehicles
   - **Crossers** - Pedestrians crossing
   - **Posers** - Pedestrians waiting/posing

4. **Analysis** - Calculates metrics
   - Arrival times
   - Inter-arrival times (time between entities)
   - Service times (how long to cross)

5. **Export** - Saves to CSV
   - Compatible with simulation software
   - Ready for statistical analysis

### Why GPU Makes Such a Difference

**Neural networks (YOLO/DeepSORT) require:**
- Millions of calculations per frame
- Matrix multiplications
- Parallel processing

**Your RTX 4060 has:**
- 3,072 CUDA cores (CPU has 8-16 cores)
- Optimized for parallel computation
- Dedicated memory (6GB VRAM)

**Result:**
- CPU: Processes 1-2 frames per second
- GPU: Processes 25-40 frames per second
- **15-25x speedup!**
