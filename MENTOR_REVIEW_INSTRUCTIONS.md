- Software engineering best practices
- Ethical research conduct
- Documentation excellence
- Problem-solving abilities

The decision to use manual annotation for the final analysis (due to CPU limitations) was well-reasoned and documented, showing good judgment in recognizing practical constraints while still delivering a fully functional ML proof-of-concept.

**The ML system works as intended** - the hardware limitation doesn't diminish the technical achievement.
