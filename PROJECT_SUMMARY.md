## Key Findings

### Bottlenecks

**Primary:** WB Vehicles
- Arrival rate: 340/hour (highest)
- Traffic intensity: ρ = 0.50 with 2 servers
- 62% more traffic than EB direction

**Temporal:** Peak period 10:07-10:12 AM
- Combined rate: 768 entities/hour
- Both directions peak simultaneously

### Sensitive Parameters (Ranked)

1. **Service Time CV** (MOST sensitive)
   - Poser CV=1.95 causes 3.8× longer waits
   - Impact: ±50% CV → ±30-40% wait time
   - **Controllable** through operational improvements

2. **Utilization (ρ)**
   - ∂W/∂ρ = 3.56 s/unit
   - 10% traffic increase → +0.36s wait time

3. **Number of Servers**
   - 1→2 servers: 67% wait time reduction
   - Highly sensitive design decision

### Distribution Insights

**Not all Exponential!**
- WB Vehicles: Lognormal (CV=1.11)
- EB Vehicles: Lognormal (CV=1.10)
- Crossers: Exponential-like (CV=1.05)
- Posers: Highly variable (CV=1.95)

**Implication:** Cannot assume Poisson arrivals (M/M/c invalid)

### Variability Decomposition

**WB Vehicles:**
- 55% from arrival variability
- 45% from service variability
- → Both sources matter!

### Time-Varying Behavior

**CV ranges:**
- Morning (first 45 min): CV ≈ 1.2 (moderate)
- Mid-session (45-65 min): CV ≈ 0.7 (regular)
- Late (65-70 min): CV ≈ 2.1 (chaotic)

**Implication:** Static capacity suboptimal; adaptive capacity beneficial

---

## Recommendations

### Capacity Configuration

**Recommended:** EB=2, WB=2, Crossers=1, Posers=2
- Meets 5-second wait time target
- Utilization: 25-50% (efficient)
- Validated by 3 independent methods

### Variability Reduction (High Impact)

**Priority 1:** Reduce Poser service time variability
- Current: CV=1.95 (extreme)
- Target: CV=1.0 (moderate)
- Method: Signage, process standardization
- Impact: 59% wait time reduction
- Implementation: Low-cost operational change

**Priority 2:** Smooth arrival patterns
- Current: Bunching (Lognormal with CV=1.11)
- Method: Traffic signals, information displays
- Impact: 28% wait time reduction

### Adaptive Capacity

**Implement state-based capacity:**
- Low variability periods (CV<0.8): Reduce to 1 server
- High variability periods (CV>1.5): Increase to 3 servers
- Detection: 5-minute rolling window CV calculation

## SIMUL8 Integration

### Entry Points

Use **fitted distributions** (not default Exponential):

**WB Vehicles:**
```
Distribution: Lognormal
  Sigma: 0.90
  Scale: 6.60
  Shift: 0
```

**EB Vehicles:**
```
Distribution: Lognormal
  Sigma: 0.88
  Scale: 6.50
  Shift: 0
```

**Crossers/Posers:**
```
Distribution: Exponential or fitted distribution from analysis
```

### Work Centers (Activities)

**EB_Crossing:**
- Servers: 2
- Service Time: Exponential (mean = 1.0s) or fitted distribution

**WB_Crossing:**
- Servers: 2
- Service Time: Exponential (mean = 1.0s) or fitted distribution

**Pedestrian_Crossing:**
- Servers: 1
- Service Time: Fitted distribution

**Photo_Area:**

- Service Time: Lognormal or fitted with high CV

### Time-Varying Arrivals

Implement schedules based on learned peak periods (see `learning_algorithms_guide.py` output)

### Adaptive Logic (Visual Logic)

Implement state-based capacity adjustment:
```vb
' Every 5 minutes, check current traffic state
If Clock MOD 300 = 0 Then
    current_cv = CalculateCurrentCV()

    If current_cv > 1.5 Then
        ' High variability state
        Set_Servers("WB_Crossing", 3)
    ElseIf current_cv < 0.8 Then
        ' Low variability state
        Set_Servers("WB_Crossing", 1)
    Else
        ' Normal state
        Set_Servers("WB_Crossing", 2)
    End If
End If
```
