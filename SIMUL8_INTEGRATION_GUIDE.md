## 📊 Data Preparation

### Understanding Your CSV Data

Your collected data contains the following columns:

```csv
ID,Time (s),Entity,Type/Dir,Inter-Arrival (s),Service Time (s)
1,7.1,EB Vehicles,EB,0.0,-
2,9.8,EB Vehicles,EB,2.6,-
3,12.3,EB Vehicles,EB,2.5,-
4,15.2,Crossers,Crosser,0.0,-
```

**Column Meanings:**

| Column | Purpose in Simul8 | Usage |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| **ID** | Entity identifier | Tracking and verification |
| **Time (s)** | Absolute arrival time | Timeline analysis |
| **Entity** | Entity type | Routing and classification |
| **Type/Dir** | Direction/Behavior | Decision logic |
| **Inter-Arrival (s)** | Time between arrivals | Distribution fitting |
| **Service Time (s)** | Processing duration | Service time definition |

### Data Quality Check

Before importing into Simul8, verify:

#### 1. Check Data Completeness

```
✓ All required columns present
✓ No missing values in critical fields
✓ Inter-arrival times calculated correctly
✓ Entity types consistent (EB Vehicles, WB Vehicles, Crossers, Posers)
```

#### 2. Validate Inter-Arrival Times

Open your CSV in Excel/Sheets and check:

```
- First entry of each entity type should have Inter-Arrival = 0.0
- Subsequent entries should have positive inter-arrival times
- Times should be realistic (e.g., not negative, not extremely large)
```

#### 3. Separate Entity Types

For Simul8, you may need to create separate files for each entity type:

**Create these files from your main CSV:**
- `eb_vehicles.csv` - Eastbound vehicles only
- `wb_vehicles.csv` - Westbound vehicles only
- `crossers.csv` - Pedestrian crossers only
- `posers.csv` - Pedestrian posers only

**How to separate (in Excel):**
1. Open main CSV file
2. Use Filter on "Entity" column
3. Select one entity type (e.g., "EB Vehicles")
4. Copy filtered data to new sheet
5. Save as separate CSV
6. Repeat for each entity type

---

## 📥 Importing Data into Simul8

### Method 1: Inter-Arrival Distribution (Recommended)

This method uses your inter-arrival times to define arrival patterns.

#### Step 1: Calculate Distribution Statistics

From your CSV data, calculate for each entity type:

**Using Excel/Python:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('arrivals.csv')

# Separate by entity type
eb_vehicles = df[df['Entity'] == 'EB Vehicles']

# Calculate statistics
inter_arrivals = eb_vehicles['Inter-Arrival (s)'][eb_vehicles['Inter-Arrival (s)'] > 0]

mean_ia = inter_arrivals.mean()
std_ia = inter_arrivals.std()
min_ia = inter_arrivals.min()
max_ia = inter_arrivals.max()

print(f"Mean Inter-Arrival: {mean_ia:.2f}s")
print(f"Std Dev: {std_ia:.2f}s")
print(f"Min: {min_ia:.2f}s, Max: {max_ia:.2f}s")
```

**Example Output:**
```
Mean Inter-Arrival: 15.3s
Std Dev: 8.7s
Min: 0.1s, Max: 45.2s
```

#### Step 2: Fit Distribution in Simul8

1. **Open Simul8** and create new simulation
2. **Add Work Entry Point** (for each entity type)
3. **Click on Work Entry Point** → Properties
4. **Set Inter-Arrival Time:**
   - Distribution Type: Choose based on data
     - Normal: `Normal(mean, std_dev)`
     - Exponential: `Exponential(mean)`
     - Triangular: `Triangular(min, mode, max)`
     - Uniform: `Uniform(min, max)`

**Example for EB Vehicles:**
```
Distribution: Normal(15.3, 8.7)
Units: Seconds
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Routing

1. **Add Work Center** for crossing area
2. **Connect** Work Entry Point → Work Center
3. **Set routing logic** by entity type
4. **Add Work Exit Point** for departures

### Method 2: Replay Real Data (Advanced)

Import actual arrival times to replay exact scenario.

#### Step 1: Prepare Arrival Schedule

Create file `arrival_schedule.csv`:
```csv
Entity_Type,Arrival_Time
EB Vehicles,7.1
EB Vehicles,9.8
EB Vehicles,12.3
Crossers,15.2
```

#### Step 2: Use Simul8 External File

1. **In Simul8:** Clock → Clock Type → External
2. **Import Schedule:** File → Import → Arrival Times
3. **Map Columns:** Entity Type → Arrival Time
4. **Configure:** Match entity types to Work Entry Points

- Pedestrians per hour

#### 3. Resource Utilization

**Crossing Utilization:**
```
(Busy Time / Total Time) × 100%
```

Target: 60-80% (efficient but not oversaturated)

**Signal Efficiency:**

- Idle time
- Conflict resolution

#### 4. Cycle Time

**Time in System:**
```
Exit Time - Entry Time
```

**Components:**
- Queue wait time
- Service time
- Routing time

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Signal Timing Optimization

**Current State Analysis:**
```
Run simulation with current signal timing
Record: Wait times, queue lengths, throughput
```

**Test Scenarios:**
```
Scenario A: Longer green for vehicles (50s green, 20s red)
Scenario B: Equal time (35s green, 35s red)
Scenario C: Favor pedestrians (30s green, 40s red)
```

**Compare Results:**
- Which minimizes total wait time?
- Which provides most balanced service?
- Which handles peak loads best?

#### 2. Capacity Adjustments

**Test Different Capacities:**
```
- Single lane vs dual lane
- One crossing point vs multiple
- Dedicated pedestrian phase vs concurrent
```

#### 3. Priority Rules

**Test Priority Schemes:**
```
Scheme 1: First-come-first-served
Scheme 2: Pedestrian priority
Scheme 3: Vehicle priority during peak hours
Scheme 4: Dynamic priority based on queue length
```

#### 4. Queue Management

**Test Queue Strategies:**
```
- FIFO (First In First Out)
- Priority queuing
- Separate queues by direction
- Overflow handling
```

### Statistical Analysis

#### Run Multiple Trials

```
1. Set Trials: 30 (for 95% confidence)
2. Run simulation
3. Export results to Excel
4. Calculate:
   - Mean and Standard Deviation
   - 95% Confidence Intervals
   - Min/Max values
```

#### Hypothesis Testing

**Example: Does signal timing affect wait time?**
```
Null Hypothesis (H0): No difference in wait time
Alternative (H1): Significant difference exists

Method:
1. Run Scenario A (current timing): 30 trials
2. Run Scenario B (new timing): 30 trials
3. Compare means using t-test
4. Accept/Reject H0 based on p-value
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Entities Not Arriving

**Symptoms:**
- Work Entry Points showing no activity
- Simulation runs but nothing happens

**Solutions:**
```
☑ Check inter-arrival time is not zero or negative
☑ Verify distribution syntax (e.g., Normal(15, 5) not Normal 15 5)
☑ Ensure simulation clock is running (not paused)
☑ Check warm-up period hasn't blocked all arrivals
```

#### Issue 2: Queue Grows Infinitely

**Symptoms:**
- Queue length increases without bound
- Simulation never reaches steady state

**Solutions:**
```
☑ Check service time < inter-arrival time (on average)
☑ Verify Work Center is processing entities (not blocked)
☑ Check routing is connected properly
☑ Ensure resources are available (not always allocated elsewhere)
```

#### Issue 3: Results Don't Match Real Data

**Symptoms:**
- Simulated metrics differ significantly from observations
- Model doesn't reflect reality

**Solutions:**
```
☑ Verify distributions are fitted correctly from data
☑ Check service times match observed durations
☑ Ensure all entity types are included
☑ Validate routing logic matches real behavior
☑ Include variability (don't use fixed values)
```

#### Issue 4: Simulation Too Slow

**Symptoms:**
- Takes too long to run trials
- Can't complete optimization scenarios

**Solutions:**
```
☑ Disable graphics during runs (Results → Graphics → Off)
☑ Reduce visual elements on canvas
☑ Run in batch mode (no animation)
☑ Use faster clock speed multiplier
☑ Reduce number of trials for initial tests
```

#### Issue 5: Conflicting Entities

**Symptoms:**
- Entities colliding or blocking each other
- Resources contention

**Solutions:**
```
☑ Add priority rules to routing
☑ Implement resource scheduling
☑ Add decision logic for conflicts
☑ Use labels to separate entity types
☑ Add conditional routing based on entity attributes
```
