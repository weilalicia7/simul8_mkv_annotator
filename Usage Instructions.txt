  Usage Instructions 

  Step 1: Get the Code from GitHub

  Option A: Using Git (if he has it)
  git clone https://github.com/weilalicia7/simul8_mkv_annotator.git
  cd simul8_mkv_annotator


  Step 2: Place Video in the Folder

  Move or copy his video file into the downloaded folder:
  simul8_mkv_annotator/
  ├── ml_processor.py
  ├── requirements.txt
  ├── ...other files...
  └── 2025-10-20 08-50-33.mkv  ← Put video here

  Important: The video should be in the same folder as the Python scripts.

  
  Step 3: Install Python Packages

  Open Command Prompt in that folder:
  # Navigate to folder
  cd C:\Users\[name]\Desktop\simul8_mkv_annotator

  # Install GPU-enabled PyTorch first
  pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

  # Install other packages
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  This takes 10-15 minutes (one-time setup)

  
  
  Step 4: Verify GPU is Working

  python -c "import torch; print('GPU Available:', torch.cuda.is_available());
  print('GPU Name:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else
  'None')"

  Should print:
  GPU Available: True
  GPU Name: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060

  

  Step 5: Process the Video

  Run this command:
  python -u ml_processor.py "2025-10-20 08-50-33.mkv" --output results.csv

  What u'll see:
  Loading YOLO model...
  Video loaded: 1280x720 @ 60.0 FPS
  Total frames: 1,499,704
  Arrival line at Y=360

  Starting video processing...

  Progress: 5.0% (74985/1499704 frames) - Detected: 45 arrivals
  Progress: 10.0% (149970/1499704 frames) - Detected: 98 arrivals
  Progress: 15.0% (224955/1499704 frames) - Detected: 152 arrivals
  ...

  Expected time: 4-8 hours (can run overnight)

  Step 6: Check the Results

  After processing completes, u'll have:
  - results.csv - This is what we need!
